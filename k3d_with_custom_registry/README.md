## 🚀 Local Kubernetes Cluster with K3d + Custom Registry + NGINX

This project bootstraps a local Kubernetes environment using [K3d](https://k3d.io/), runs a **local Docker registry**, and deploys a simple NGINX service using manifests. The NGINX image is pulled from your custom registry, simulating private image usage in real-world Kubernetes deployments.

kubectl cluster-info
```

This will:

* Create a K3d cluster
* Start a local Docker registry named `k3d-registry`
* Wire the registry to the cluster's containerd runtime


## 🐳 Build & Push Custom NGINX Image

```bash
❯ make build.push
❯ make build.push
docker pull nginx:latest
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
Digest: sha256:dc53c8f25a10f9109190ed5b59bda2d707a3bde0e45857ce9e1efaa32ff9cbc1
Status: Image is up to date for nginx:latest
docker.io/library/nginx:latest

What's next:
    View a summary of image vulnerabilities and recommendations → docker scout quickview nginx:latest
docker tag nginx:latest localhost:5000/nginx:latest
docker push localhost:5000/nginx:latest
The push refers to repository [localhost:5000/nginx]

```

This will:

1. Pull the official `nginx:latest`
2. Tag and push it to your local registry at `localhost:5000/nginx:latest`


## 🚀 NGINX Deployment



```bash
❯ make deploy.nginx
kubectl apply -f ngnix-manifest/namespace.yaml
namespace/nginx-app created
kubectl apply -f ngnix-manifest/deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
kubectl apply -f ngnix-manifest/service.yaml
service/nginx-service created

❯ make deploy.view
kubectl get pods -n nginx-app
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-5cd97745bd-5dtwt   1/1     Running   0          3s
nginx-deployment-5cd97745bd-9k4vk   1/1     Running   0          3s
kubectl get svc -n nginx-app
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service   LoadBalancer   10.43.77.125   <pending>     80:31318/TCP   3s
```


You should see:

* 2 running NGINX pods
* LoadBalancer service exposing port 80



### Test the NGINX App

```bash
❯ make test.nginx
curl --fail http://localhost:8080 || echo "NGINX not reachable"
```

You should see the default NGINX welcome page.

Add hostname `registry` to `/etc/hosts` and then push the image with tag `registry:5000/nginx:latest` and also ensure that the image name is also updated in deployment.


## 🧹 Delete Deployment and Cluster

```bash
❯ make delete.nginx     # Delete NGINX deployment, service, and namespace
❯ make delete           # Delete the full cluster
```
